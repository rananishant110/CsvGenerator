# Instructions:
This mode is designed to assist with planning and organizing feature documentation. The workflow consists of creating structured documentation before development, maintaining a documentation system, and ensuring consistency across all planning documents.

## Project Context


- **Frontend**: 
- **Backend**: 
- **Authentication**: 
- **Architecture**: 

## Documentation Structure

### Directory Organization
All documentation must be stored in the `docs` directory. The structure is maintained in `docs/tree.md`.

#### Directory Naming Convention
- **Features**: `feat-<feature-name>` (e.g., `feat-user-authentication`, `feat-goal-setting-api`)
- **Fixes**: `fix-<issue-name>` (e.g., `fix-login-error`, `fix-auth-password`)

#### File Naming Convention
Within each feature/fix directory:
- PRD Document: `<directory-name>.prd.md`
- Plan Document: `<directory-name>.plan.md`

Example structure:
```
docs/
├── tree.md
├── feat-goal-setting-api/
│   ├── feat-goal-setting-api.prd.md
│   └── feat-goal-setting-api.plan.md
├── feat-debt-api/
│   ├── feat-debt-api.prd.md
│   └── feat-debt-api.plan.md
└── fix-auth-password/
   ├── fix-auth-password.prd.md
   └── fix-auth-password.plan.md
```

### Initial Setup
1. If `docs` directory doesn't exist, create it
2. If `docs/tree.md` doesn't exist, create it with initial structure
3. Always read `docs/tree.md` first to understand existing documentation

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: PRD Document Creation
When asked to create a new feature or fix:

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Gather all user requirements through clarifying questions
   - Identify the problem being solved
   - Define success criteria
   - Consider existing project architecture and patterns

2. **Create PRD Document**
   - Create appropriate directory: `docs/feat-<name>` or `docs/fix-<name>`
   - Create PRD file: `<directory-name>.prd.md`
   - Include the following sections:
      - **Title**: Feature/Fix name
      - **Overview**: Brief description
      - **Problem Statement**: What problem this solves
      - **User Stories**: Who benefits and how
      - **Functional Requirements**: Detailed feature specifications
      - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
      - **API Specifications**: Endpoints, DTOs, response formats (if applicable)
      - **UI/UX Requirements**: Interface design, user flows (if applicable)
      - **Success Criteria**: How to measure completion
      - **Constraints & Assumptions**: Technical or business limitations
      - **Dependencies**: External systems or features required
      - **Security Considerations**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

3. **Update Tree Documentation**
   - Add new directory to `docs/tree.md`
   - Include brief description of the feature/fix
   - Maintain alphabetical ordering within categories

### Phase 2: Plan Document Creation
After PRD approval:

1. **Create Plan Document**
   - Create file: `<directory-name>.plan.md`
   - Structure with milestones and tasks
   - Consider project-specific patterns and existing codebase

2. **Plan Document Structure**
   ```markdown
   # Development Plan: [Feature Name]
   
   ## Overview
   Brief summary linking to PRD
   
   ## Milestones
   
   ### Milestone 1: [Name]
   - [ ] Status: Not Started
   - Description: What this milestone achieves
   - Estimated Duration: X days
   
   #### Tasks:
   - [ ] Task 1.1: Description
   - [ ] Task 1.2: Description
   - [ ] Task 1.3: Description
   
   ### Milestone 2: [Name]
   - [ ] Status: Not Started
   ...
   
   ## Technical Considerations
   - Architecture decisions
   - Technology choices
   - Integration points
   - Database schema changes
   - API contract definitions
   
   ## Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests required
   - Integration tests
   - User acceptance criteria
   - Performance benchmarks
   
   ## Risk Assessment
   - Potential blockers
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Rollback procedures
   ```

3. **Task Definition Guidelines**
   - Each milestone should represent a significant deliverable
   - Tasks should be atomic and completable in 1-4 hours
   - Include clear acceptance criteria for each task
   - Consider dependencies between tasks
   - Follow existing project patterns and standards

## Documentation Standards

### PRD Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include mockups or diagrams where helpful (using Mermaid syntax)
- Reference existing project components and patterns
- Consider authentication and authorization requirements
- Define clear API contracts with TypeScript interfaces
- Specify validation rules and error handling approaches

### Plan Standards
- Break down work into logical, testable milestones
- Consider both backend (NestJS) and frontend (Next.js) tasks
- Include database migration requirements
- Specify integration points with existing features
- Account for testing and documentation time

### Version Control
- Commit documentation changes with descriptive messages:
   - `docs: Add PRD for <feature-name>`
   - `docs: Update plan for <feature-name>`
   - `docs: Update tree.md with <feature-name>`

## Quality Checks

Before completing any phase:
- Ensure all required sections are present
- Verify naming conventions are followed
- Confirm tree.md is updated
- Check that documentation aligns with project standards
- Validate technical feasibility against existing architecture
- Ensure security and performance considerations are addressed

## Integration with Tools

### Obsidian Integration
- Use Obsidian for personal note-taking and brainstorming
- Link to relevant vault notes when applicable
- Search existing notes for related concepts


## Command Recognition

When user says:
- "Start a new feature for X" → Begin Phase 1 (PRD Creation)
- "Create the plan" → Begin Phase 2 (Plan Document)
- "Update the tree" → Update docs/tree.md
- "Review existing features" → List and summarize docs directory

## Review Checkpoints
- After PRD creation: Pause for user review before proceeding
- After Plan creation: Pause for user review before marking complete
- Always confirm directory and file names before creation
- Summarize key decisions for user validation
