## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Backend**: FastAPI for high-performance async API development
- **Frontend**: React with functional components and hooks for modern development
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS framework
- **ML Processing**: Local Hugging Face models for privacy and performance
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for efficient Excel and CSV operations

### Technology Choices
- **Python Version**: 3.8+ for compatibility with ML libraries
- **Node.js Version**: 16+ for modern React features
- **ML Model**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for fast semantic similarity
- **Similarity Algorithm**: Cosine similarity for efficient vector comparison
- **File Handling**: Multipart file uploads with FastAPI

### Integration Points
- **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **File Processing**: Asynchronous file handling for large uploads
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

### Database Schema Changes
- **In-Memory Storage**: No persistent database required for MVP
- **Data Structures**: Pydantic models for type safety and validation
- **File Storage**: Temporary CSV files with automatic cleanup

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Required
- **Backend Services**: Catalog service, order processor, file handling
- **Data Models**: Schema validation and data transformation
- **ML Components**: Embedding generation and similarity calculation
- **Frontend Components**: Component rendering and user interactions

### Integration Tests
- **API Endpoints**: End-to-end API testing with sample data
- **File Processing**: Excel loading, text processing, and CSV generation
- **Frontend-Backend**: Complete user workflow testing

### User Acceptance Criteria
- **File Upload**: Successfully process various text file formats
- **Item Mapping**: Achieve 90%+ accuracy for common grocery items
- **Performance**: Process 100+ items in under 30 seconds
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear feedback

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Model Loading**: < 10 seconds for Hugging Face model
- **Processing Speed**: < 30 seconds for 100+ items
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB RAM for typical catalog sizes
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for API endpoints

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Blockers
- **ML Model Size**: Large model files may cause slow initial loading
- **Memory Usage**: Processing large Excel files may exceed available RAM
- **Browser Compatibility**: Advanced React features may not work in older browsers
- **Python Dependencies**: Version conflicts with ML libraries

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Model Optimization**: Use lightweight models and implement lazy loading
- **Memory Management**: Implement streaming and chunked processing
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works in all browsers
- **Dependency Management**: Use virtual environments and pin specific versions

### Rollback Procedures
- **Backend Rollback**: Revert to previous FastAPI version if needed
- **Frontend Rollback**: Deploy previous React build
- **Model Rollback**: Switch to alternative ML model if performance issues arise
- **Data Recovery**: Maintain backup of original Excel files

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- **Python**: PEP 8 compliance, type hints, comprehensive docstrings
- **JavaScript**: ESLint configuration, consistent formatting
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage for critical components
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and comprehensive README

### Version Control
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for each milestone
- **Commit Messages**: Conventional commits with clear descriptions
- **Code Review**: Required for all changes before merging
- **Release Tags**: Semantic versioning for stable releases

### Deployment Process
- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Testing**: Automated testing on pull requests
- **Staging**: Manual testing environment before production
- **Production**: Manual deployment with rollback capability
